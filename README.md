# Space Cadets

Welcome to the Space Cadets website, your gateway to the wonders of the cosmos! Embark on an interstellar journey through the planets of our solar system and uncover fascinating facts about each one. Powered by cutting-edge web technologies like HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, and React, our site brings the mysteries of space right to your fingertips. The data you explore is sourced from a dynamic external API, ensuring that the information is as fresh and up-to-date as the stars themselves.

This site is the result of a collaborative effort by our dedicated team of space explorers: Brian, Nausica, Simon, Darly and Viktor. A huge thank you to my amazing teammates for their hard work and creativity in making this project a reality.

Ready to launch? Letâ€™s explore the universe together - one planet at a time!
